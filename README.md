# YOLO-for-car-detection
This is a repository that uses YOLO for car detection in both videos and images
Here I already have a .h5 file in my models folder.If you want to use it for other model you can dowmnload one from https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/
If you want to use this on an image goto yad2k->models->keras_yolo.py.Goto yolo_eval and remove the comments for a single line of code which is mentioned there.
